## About Me

I am a researcher and engineer with a strong background in signal processing, machine learning, and graph-based AI, currently transitioning into quantitative finance and fintech. My research focuses on **time series analysis**, **generative AI**, and **graph neural networks**, with applications in financial modeling, source localization, and recommendation systems.

I hold a **PhD in Electrical Engineering** from the University of Rochester and am currently pursuing a **Master of Science in Financial Engineering** at the City University of Hong Kong. I have hands-on experience in building automated trading systems, developing AI-driven forecasting models, and improving real-world machine learning systems during my internship at **Amazon**.
